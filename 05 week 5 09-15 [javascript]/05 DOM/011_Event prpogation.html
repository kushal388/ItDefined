<!-- 
Event Propagation is the process by which an event moves through the DOM tree. When an event occurs (like a click), 
it doesn't just affect the element that was clicked—it travels through three phases:

Capturing Phase (Trickling Down):

    The event starts from the window and travels down through the DOM tree to the target element.
     You can listen to this phase by passing true as the third parameter in addEventListener.

Target Phase:

    The event reaches the actual element that triggered the event (e.g., the button you clicked).
    This is where the event is handled by the element itself.

Bubbling Phase:

   After the event reaches the target, it bubbles back up the DOM tree from the target to the root.
   This is the default phase when you use addEventListener without true
